Main functions of splunk

1) index - collects data
2)Search and investigate 
3)Add knowledge
4)Monitor and alert
5)Report and analyze

Components
1)Indexer
2)Search Head - allow users to search data
3)Forwaders - consume data and forward data to indexers

Three roles in splunk app
1) Admin - powerful and decides incoming data to splunk
2)Power - create and share knowledge objects to users and do real time search
3)User - Will only see the objects shared with them

Splunk search:

->search and reporting app provides access to search and analyze data
-> It helps in creating 
	1)knowledge Objects
	2)reports
	3)Dashboards etc
	
Data Summary:
1)Hosts
2)Sources
3)Source_types

Using Feilds
-> in feilds side bar feilds are broken t two categories
 1) Selected feilds (Most important feilds)
 2)Interested feilds (feilds have values in at least 20% of events)
 
 ->Host source and sourcetype feilds are selected by default
 -'a' denotes a string value '#' denotes a numeric value

 Best Practises:
 ->Time to limit (less data we search the faster splunk will return)
  ->Default feilds like index source sourcetype host
  -> The more information we give to search the more efficeint search will be
  ->Inclusion is better than exclusion
  -> Apply fitering commands as early as possible in search
 Using time:
	->Splunk provides differnt time range to search forward
	-> like alltime,week, month,relative  and realtime
	->realtime search will help us to find out what is happening with data in realtime
Using indexes:
	->Splunk store data in indexes for searching
	->often uses multiple indexes to segregate data
	->Seaching based on indexes can make searches more efficient
	->admin can regulate access to specific indexes for security reason
	
 SPL Fundamentals:
 SPL is based on five components
  1)Search terms
  2)Commands (what we want to do with search results)
  3)Funtions
  4)Arguments
  5)clauses
  
  Feilds - allows to include or exclude feilds from search command 
			will be helpful to limit feilds to be displayed and make search faster
Table - Retains data in tabular format
Rename - used to rename feilds * if we rename feilds we can no longer search the events with old names
Dedup - remove duplicate commands
sort - sorting results in asc or desc

Transforming commands:
 - Order search results into data table for stastical purposes
 
Top:finds most common values of the given feild in the result set
  -> returns count and percent values
  eg : |Top "feildname" "clauses"
   Clauses used in top command
    -limit =int
	-countfeild =string
	-percentfeild=string
	-showcount=boolean
	-showpercent=boolean
	-useother = boolean
	
Rare:works similar to top command but shows least common values
Stats: Used to produce stastics of search results
  common stat functions are 
   -count - returns total no of search results
   -distinctcount - provides how many unique values are present in search results
   -sum - will produce sum of numeric values in
   -average - creates a avegage value for a given feild
   -min - return minimum value for a given feild
   -max - return maximum value for a given feild
   -list -list all feild values for a given feild
   -values -list all unique feild values for a given feild
   
   
  count function:
	eg:index=sales sourcetype=vendor_sales | stats count as "Total sales by vendors" by "product name"
		->"as" clause is used to change name of column
		->"by" class will return count based in each feild value
		
   Dinstinct count(dc):
	eg: index=sales sourcetype=vendor_sales |stats distinct_count("productname")
	->"as" clause is used to change name of column
		->"by" class will return count based in each feild value
   Sum:
    eg:index=sales sourcetype=vendor_sales |stats sum("price")  as "gross_sales" by "product name"
		-> will reuturn sum or price of all products sold

  average(avg),min,max : only work on numeric values
	eg:index=sales sourcetype=vendor_sales |stats avg("price") 
	
 List: 
  eg: index=bcgassets source_type=asset_list |stats list(asset) as "company assets" by Employee
  
  Values:
	eg : index=network sourceType=cisco_wsa_squid |stats values(hostname) by sc_username
   
 Reports and dashboards:
  ->click save as button and enter details
  naming convention: groupofreport_typeofobject_shortdescription
 Dashboards: collection of reports
 
Pivot and DataSets

--Pivot is a data model created by admin or power roles for the users not having knowledge about search language
